/*OKAY, I know this is somewhat BAD but I saw this photoshopped image ages ago and thought it was too hilarious so I literally couldn't resist. Fits the "discrete" theme perfectly. Plus I actually got Chris Hadfield (the astronaut) to reply to me on Twitter once so that was cool. Not condoning drug use but I mean... this is hilarious. 10/10 Photoshop.
